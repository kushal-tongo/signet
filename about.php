			<h2>How I thought of this proposal and it’s implementation.</h2>
			<p>The class was going on, everyone seemed to be puppets in hands of the teacher. Why puppet? It is good for students to pay attention when they are being taught, but surprisingly the case was a bit different here. They were not being taught, they were being 'controlled'. Paying heed in the class was just for namesake to get the attendance. There was no zeal or zest to learn or acquire. Seeing in the white-board, analysing the graphs, but the mind wandering somewhere else, maybe pondering about when the class terminates and getting freed – the notion of so-called 'freedom' that appeared to be a distant dream. In fact an illusion, captivating me with the idea of mirage. I therefore decided to enter the class as late as possible, to skip some part of the poor class and to keep myself busy as well as away from this dullness. The class factually spreaded sluggishness.</p> <p>Though I liked the subject, and at the same time I had no problem with the teacher, I had a damn serious issue with the methodology. Say it as a strict aversion, a constant dislike. It was like a convention, not the contemporary world. I knew time heals everything, it is a good master.</p> <p>I wanted that time to come running after me. In fact 'good' times to approach at a hurried pace towards me. I needed the much required projector [which was in fact present in many other classes of the college but not in this one] in the class so that some kind of movie could be shown pouring</p> <p>Its contents on the surface of the white-board, making things lovely, bright and interesting. After all 'economy' in itself is amazing, realistic, dynamic and vivid. So why not bring about a magic in the teaching system too, creating it more magnificent and not virtual.</p><p>
The murmuring in the class could be heard- for the interests were
inclined in the direction of friends and not the professor. It was like
'spending' your time and not 'utilising' it. That 5 marks of attendance
used to set a terrifying chain of events for it decided your interaction
with the teacher, setting an impression, buttering her for your
selfishness and benefits.
                  </p><p>  The idea seemed to be quite clear,get this moment to
pass-by in the same velocity, for you couldn't change the schedule of
the class but surely you could change the waves of your life, by doing
what you liked and using time as money.
 </p>
 <p>
The cacophony buzzing inside the mind clearly made me know that i
was stuck somewhere,not in the islands, not in the deserts but
somewhere inmidst of that class where clear turmoil was flashing
infront of my eyes: in the way incidents were proceeding one after
another.</p>
   <p>While writing and taking a note of all these, sometimes i even
had to raise my head and give an eye-contact to the 'miss', giving her
an approval that i was patiently and religiously listening to her; along
with this the head was to be nodded in affirmation even if u did not
want to, afterall i told you before about this 'CONVENTION'.
All that revolved around my mind was a negation; a disgusting “NO”,
but i got carried away by the circumstance and did what a student of
rat-race would do-yup, saying YES and working in the manner the
tutor wanted you to! The freedom was no more,only solitude remained!
</p>
<p>This is my story which inspired me to start the Economics Junction.
   Thankyou! </p>
